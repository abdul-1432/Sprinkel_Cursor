Sprinkle Cursors is a fun and interactive web application that changes the cursor's appearance into a sprinkle animation whenever the user clicks on the screen. The sprinkles not only make your website more engaging but also change color randomly on each click, adding a touch of creativity and excitement for your users.

This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it lightweight and easy to integrate into your website or web application.

## Getting Started

To use the Sprinkle Cursors on your website, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```
   [https://github.com/abdul-1432/Sprinkel_Cursor]
   ```

2. **Include the necessary files**:

   Add the following files to your project's directory:

   - `index.html`
   - `styles.css`
   - `script.js`

3. **Link the CSS and JavaScript**:

   In your `index.html` file, link the CSS and JavaScript files in the `<head>` and before the closing `</body>` tag, respectively:

   ```HTML
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
   <script src="script.js"></script>
   ```

4. **Create the sprinkle elements**:

   Inside the `<body>` tag of your `index.html`, add a container element where the sprinkles will appear:

   ```HTML
   <div class="sprinkle-container"></div>
   ```

5. **Customize the appearance (optional)**:

   Feel free to adjust the CSS in the `styles.css` file to match your website's design or customize the sprinkle animation as per your preferences.

6. **Enjoy!**:

   Once you've completed the above steps, you're ready to go. Open your `index.html` file in a web browser, and whenever you click on the screen, the cursor will turn into sprinkles with a randomly changing color.
